# Salesforce-Internship

Salesforce is a cloud-based software company headquartered in California, specializing in software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings and made its name with its wide range of customer-relationship management (CRM) services and also provides enterprise applications focused on customer service, marketing automation, analytics, and application development.

I completed their 8 week developer virtual internship and it was a good learning experience.
